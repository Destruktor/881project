Inspecting the whole dataset

1, get rid of the vehicle_new_cost_amount by inspecting outlier (-1), only 7000+ records found of value -1
2, policy_zipcode replace it by a number that does not exist in the current zip codes
3, vehicle_make_description, do we need to remove this column? thereâ€™s no outlier
4, vehicle_symbol, keep it
5, vehicle_number_of_drivers_assigned, outlier 99;
6, vehicle_miles_to_work, -1 exists in half of the records, replace -1 by average;
7, vehicle_days_per_week_driven, 19 records have the value of -1;
8, vehicle_annual_miles, only 90 of records are NOT unknown, should we discard this field?
9, vehicle_anti_theft_devices, replace unknown by other value;
10, vehicle_passive_restraint, replace 81 records with unknown by Y, since we have more Ys;
11, vehicle_med_pay_limit, fill the -1s with average value;
12, vehicle_bodily_injury_limit, 17000+ NA data records, should we replace them by average or consider them as another category? There are 8 levels; set 3 levels: 0 - 100, 100 - 300, 300 - 500
	NOTE: $50,000/$100,000
	The first dollar amount ($50,000) represents the coverage limit for damages if only one person is injured in an accident.The second dollar amount ($100,000) represents the coverage limit for the total amount of damages if more than one person is injured.
What about the NA then?

x column: vehicle physical damage limit: 17338/424431 missing, P(claim|missing)=814/17338=0.047=average (suggestion: put them to different levels evenly or predict the missing values)
y column: vehicle comprehensive coverage indicator: no missing, replace Y/N with 1/0
z column: vehicle comprehensive coverage limit: missing too many 407486/424431 P(claim|missing)=18088/407486=0.044=average (suggestion: delete this column)
aa column: vehicle collision coverage indicator: no missing, replace Y/N with 1/0
ab column: vehicle collision coverage deductible: 165706/424431 missing ,P(claim|missing)=3439/165706=0.021 obviously less than average (suggestion: let missing be a new level or predicthe)
ac-ao column: good to go, but suggestion: delete al and am column(minimum age& maximum age), they can be classified into age ranges
